Naive Bayes Classification Model

Feature engineering was performed to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. Refer to Feature Engineering.ipynb using nba-players.csv file. A Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification model was used to predict whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more. Refer to Naive Bayes Classification Model.ipynb using the extracted_nba_players.csv file.

The classification model has reasonable predictive power with an F1 score of 0.6627. The model performed better at accurately identifying those players who will likely play for more than five years than it did those who likely will not. I am curious to try other models to see if another model performs better. As well as, apply the model to more recent data. Specificially, for the WNBA and the European League.
